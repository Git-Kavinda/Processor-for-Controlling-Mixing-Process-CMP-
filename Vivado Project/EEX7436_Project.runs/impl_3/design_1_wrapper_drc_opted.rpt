REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/Processor_0/U0/No_CTR_sys/Speed_mem/array_reg_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/Processor_0/U0/No_CTR_sys/Speed_mem/array_reg_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[11] (net: design_1_i/Processor_0/U0/No_CTR_sys/Speed_mem/RAdd[7]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/Processor_0/U0/No_CTR_sys/Ins_reg/Q_reg[8]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
